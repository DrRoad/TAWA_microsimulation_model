# Tax And Welfare Analysis (TAWA) microsimulation model

The Tax And Welfare Analysis (TAWA) microsimulation model is New Zealand Treasury's static microsimulation model of the personal tax and transfer system. Microsimulation models are a key tool used to analyse the effect of major policy reforms on households. They carry out calculations on a collection of individual records and can aggregate the policy impacts for particular groups, or the whole population. They are especially useful for analysing the effects of policy where policies interact with each other and a diverse range of outcomes are experienced by individuals in differing circumstances.

This repository contains the source code for TAWA. To run this code requires access to Treasury's processed version of the Household Economic Survey (HES) data, which requires approval from both Statistics New Zealand and the Treasury. More information about Statistics New Zealand's approval process can be found at http://archive.stats.govt.nz/tools_and_services/microdata-access/data-lab.aspx. Upon request the Treasury can be consulted during this process.

The Treasury have made this code available as Open Source Software to enable continual improvement as a result of the user community implementing the code for its own purposes and publishing improvements. This collaborative atmosphere can make it easier to conduct peer review, to reuse existing solutions, and to share technical knowledge.
